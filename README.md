To implement the auto-incrementing version number in your ASP.NET Core Web API project using `version.txt` and PowerShell script (`IncrementScript.ps1`), here's a detailed breakdown of where you can verify and make changes:

### 1. `version.txt` File

The `version.txt` file will store the current version number of your application. This file should be created in your project directory and should initially contain the starting version number. For example:

```
1.0.0.0
```

### 2. `.csproj` File Changes

Open your ASP.NET Core Web API project's `.csproj` file and add the following lines inside the `<Project>` tag:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- Define a property to store the current version number -->
  <VersionPrefix>1.0.0</VersionPrefix>
</PropertyGroup>

<Target Name="IncrementVersion" BeforeTargets="Build">
  <Exec Command="powershell -File $(ProjectDir)\IncrementScript.ps1" />
</Target>
```

#### Explanation:
- `<VersionPrefix>`: Defines a property to hold the current version number of your project. This can be initialized to your starting version (e.g., `1.0.0`).
- `<Target Name="IncrementVersion" BeforeTargets="Build">`: This target executes the PowerShell script (`IncrementScript.ps1`) just before each build (`BeforeTargets="Build"`).

### 3. `IncrementScript.ps1` PowerShell Script

Create a PowerShell script file named `IncrementScript.ps1` in your project directory. This script reads the current version from `version.txt`, increments it, and updates `version.txt`. Here's an example:

```powershell
# Path to version.txt file
$versionFile = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\version.txt"

# Read current version
$currentVersion = Get-Content $versionFile

# Parse the version components
$major = 0
$minor = 0
$patch = 0
$revision = 0

if ($currentVersion -match '(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)') {
    $major = [int]$matches[1]
    $minor = [int]$matches[2]
    $patch = [int]$matches[3]
    $revision = [int]$matches[4]
}

# Increment revision number
$revision++

# Format the new version
$newVersion = "$major.$minor.$patch.$revision"

# Write new version to version.txt
$newVersion | Set-Content $versionFile -Force

# Output the new version (optional, for debugging)
Write-Output "New version: $newVersion"
```

#### Explanation:
- `$versionFile`: Specifies the path to the `version.txt` file within your project directory.
- `$currentVersion`: Retrieves the current version stored in `version.txt`.
- Version parsing and incrementing logic: Splits the version into major, minor, patch, and revision components, increments the revision, and updates the `version.txt` file with the new version.

### Verification

To verify that your implementation is working correctly:

1. **Build the Project**: Each time you build your ASP.NET Core Web API project, the `IncrementScript.ps1` script should execute automatically, incrementing the version number in `version.txt`.
   
2. **Check `version.txt`**: After each build, open `version.txt` to confirm that the revision number has incremented as expected.

3. **Runtime Access**: You can access the version number programmatically in your application using methods like `AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute`, or read `version.txt` during runtime to display the current version to users or log it for debugging purposes.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and automate the versioning of your ASP.NET Core Web API project using `version.txt` and a PowerShell script, ensuring that your application's version number increments consistently with each build.
